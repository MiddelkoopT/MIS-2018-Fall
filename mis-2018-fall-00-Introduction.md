## Introduction to MIS 

So you want to be an Engineer. You need to use, understand, and be
comfortable with information technology.  This is the course for that.

### Outline 
 * Welcome and personal introduction
 * Motivation for the class (information technology and computational engineering)
 * Module outline
 * Hands on with secure shell (ssh).

### Hands on
 * Use a secure shell client and connect to `clark.rnet.missouri.edu` using your pawprint login (SSO) and password.  You must use all lower case for your username and do not include the `@` or anything after it.
 * The following ssh clients are recommended: 
   * MobaXterm (https://missouri.app.box.com/rcss-mobaxterm) for Windows, 
   * Putty (https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w32/putty.exe ) for Windows, 
   * or hterm, the Chrome browser “Secure Shell” extension for Windows, Mac, and Chromebooks (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo).
   * Mac users can use the built-in terminal by launching it from Spotlight by hitting `Command + Spacebar` and typing `Terminal` and then return.  To connect to the teaching cluster enter the command `ssh pawprint@clark.rnet.missouri.edu` where `pawprint` is your login (SSO) and enter your password when prompted.

### Homework 0
  1. Homework 0-1: Using Secure Shell
     1. Connect to clark.rnet.missouri.edu with your pawprint (SSO) and pawprint password and run the following commands and copy and paste the session (as text).
        1. `hostname`
        1. `whoami |sum`
  2. Homework 0-2: What is an information system?
     1. What are the five components that make up an information system?
     2. Of the five primary components of an information system (hardware, software, data, people, process), which do you think is the most important to the success of a business organization? Write a one-paragraph answer to this question that includes an example from your personal experience to support your answer.

### Discussion 
 * What does IT mean to you?
 * What about technology things would you like to know about?

Information Technology (IT), and by extension Management Information
Systems (MIS), is the **physical**, **computational**, and **software**,
infrastructure built by **teams**, to manage **information**.

IT needs **physical** infrastructure consisting of
 * power, 
 * cooling,
 * and space,

to supports the fundamental **computational** resources 
 * compute,
 * storage, and
 * networking.

From these resources a **software** system is built through
 * provisioning (physical and logical), 
 * configuration,
 * software (Operating System, libraries, applications), and
 * security.

This infrastructure is used to **manage information** (data) through 
 * business process,
 * data,
 * policy, and
 * security.

All this is all brought together by **teams** with 
 * people,
 * process, and
 * community.

** Security a fundamental property of systems and applications.
